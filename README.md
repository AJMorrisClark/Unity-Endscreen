# Unity Endscreen
Project for Unity Technologies

## About
This project was part of the interview process with Unity. The goal of the project was this: Imagine someone has just finished watching a video about a mobile game they might want to buy. Build an endscreen that they will see once the video has finished. The instructions were to choose any existing mobile game and pull the game's info and images from the iTunes store using the API. Then I was to insert the information and images into my html to create a slideshow that could be moved to the left or right by touch along with a title, a game icon, and a download button. There were no limits to the design/layout or the technology to use.
This project is meant to be viewed on a mobile device.
I was asked to design it to fit iphone5, iphone 6 and iphone 6 Plus in both landscape and portrait orientation.
